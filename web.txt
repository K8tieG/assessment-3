How does the internet work?

The internet is a vast network of computers that are connected and communicate with one another. Every device connected to the 
internet has a unique Internet Protocol or IP address. An IP address acts much like a mailing address in terms of how information 
is sent and tracked. Doamain names are ascribed to IP addresses to make it easier for us to recall the names of websites in place 
of using their unique IP address which is a series of numbers. 

A person enters the domain name of a website and the broweser sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) server, 
bascially the internet phone book where all IP addresses are stored. After the DNS finds the IP address the brower forwards the 
request on to a data center or particular server for the particular website. The server then sends the information back to you.

Information is sent in the form of packages. Bascially information is broken down into smaller chunks so it can be more easily 
and rapily transported back to the client computer.



What happens when you click on a link?

When you click on a link, you active a request. Your browser and operating system start to determine where you have clicked, 
and what uniform resource locator (url) information you have clicked on to view next. Inside of a URL is the name of the website
that you've asked to view. Your browser breaks out the URL so it can grab the name name of the web site you'd like you view
and then uses the DNS to get the correct IP address for the site. Then your browser opens the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
over the IP address. It reqeusts to chat with the Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server which then provides the markeup language, HTML
your browser renders so you can view the clicked link webpage.
